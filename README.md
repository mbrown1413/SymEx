SymEx is a verified symbolic execution engine. It is written in Dafny, a language with
the ability to statically prove properties about programs.

Information on the properties proven: [PROPERTIES.md](PROPERTIES.md)


## Requirements

### Mono

The 64-bit mono build is required, because we need to interface with Z3.

On Linux you may be able to install the `mono` package from your package
manager.

Otherwise you can compile from source:
  * [Linux Instructions](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/linux/)
  * [Mac Instructions](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/mac/)

We've tested with:

  * Mono Version 5.3.0 amd64 on Mac
  * Mono Version 4.2.1 amd64 on Linux

### Dafny

See: [Dafny build instructions](https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny/wiki/INSTALL)

If you didn't install Dafny globally, you will need to make the `dafny`
executable available when compiling. If you downloaded the binary release, you
should put the binaries directory in your PATH like this:

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/<dafny-directory>/Binaries/

Put the above in your `.bashrc` to make the change permanent.

We've tested with:

  * Dafny Version 1.9.9.40414 on Mac and Linux

### Z3

Download the latest from their
[releases](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases) and unzip it.

Alternatively, they have instructions to [build from
source](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). Make sure to include `--dotnet` to
compile the C# bindings.

When compiling SymEx, `Microsoft.Z3.dll` needs to be available. This file will
be in `z3-<version>/bin/` in the binary release, or in `build/` if you compiled
from source. The simplest way to make this available is link to it in the SymEx
directory:

    $ cd SymEx/
    $ ln -s /path/to/Microsoft.Z3.dll

## Compiling

Compile:

    $ make

You may see errors like this:

    satNative.cs(8,17) : error CS0234: The type or namespace name `Z3' does not exist in the namespace `Microsoft'. Are you missing an assembly reference?

Before panicking that Z3 could not be found, see if `symexec.exe` exists. If
so, everything compiled fine. Dafny may not be able to find `Microsoft.Z3.dll`
when it generates the C# code, but we compile the C# code afterwards in a
separate step that looks for `Microsoft.Z3.dll` in the current directory.

## Running

    $ mono symexec.exe

or

    $ ./symexec.exe
